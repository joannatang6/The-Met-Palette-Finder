# The-Met-Palette-Finder

Using the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access Initiative(https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess), this Shiny App will allow you to explore the Met Collection, and even use jpegs of paintings to create a color palette to inspire your own work.

To begin, you will need a copy of the MetObjects.csv (file too large to upload here currently, see: https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).  

Currently, I am still having difficutly scraping open access images, so making a color palette from the collection is still not working.  More updates to follow.
